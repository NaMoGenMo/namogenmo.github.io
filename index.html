  <p>National Novel Generation Month - based on <a href="https://twitter.com/tinysubversions/status/396305662000775168">an idea Darius Kazemi tweeted on a whim</a>

  <h2>Editions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015">2015</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014">2014</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo">2013</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Goal</h2>

  <p>Spend the month of November writing code that generates a novel of 50k+ words. This is in the spirit of <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a>'s interesting <a href="https://nanowrimo.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/329132-why-50-000-words-and-how-do-you-define-novel">definition of a novel</a> as 50,000 words of fiction.

  <h2>The Rules</h2>

  <p>The only rule is that you share at least one novel and also your source code at the end.

  <p>The source code does not have to be licensed in a particular way, so long as you share it. The code itself does not need to be on GitHub, either. I'm just using this repo as a place to organize the community. (Convenient because many programmers have GitHub accounts and the Issues section works like a forum with excellent syntax highlighting.)

  <p>The "novel" is defined however you want. It could be 50,000 repetitions of the word "meow". It could literally grab a random novel from Project Gutenberg. It doesn't matter, as long as it's 50k+ words.

  <p><i>Please try to respect copyright.</i> I'm not going to police it, as ultimately it's on your head if you want to just copy/paste a Stephen King novel or whatever, but the most useful/interesting implementations are going to be ones that don't engender lawsuits.

  <p>This activity starts at 12:01am GMT on Nov 1st and ends at 12:01am GMT Dec 1st.

  <h2>How to Participate</h2>

  <p>Open an issue on the edition's repo and declare your intent to participate. <i>If you already have some inkling of the kind of project you'll be doing, please title your issue accordingly.</i> You may continually update the issue as you work over the course of the month. Feel free to post dev diaries, sample output, etc.

  <p></p>Also feel free to comment on other participants' issues.

  <h2>Admins</h2>

  <p>Official admins for NaNoGenMo are @dariusk and @hugovk. We'll be doing our best to keep the issues section well organized and tagged.

  <h2>Resources</h2>

  <p>There's an open issue for each edition where you can add resources (libraries, corpuses, APIs, techniques, etc).

  <p>There are already a ton of resources on the old resources threads for the <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/11">2013</a>m the <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/nanogenmo-2014/issues/1">2014</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/nanogenmo-2015/issues/1">2015</a> editions.

  <p>You might want to check out [corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora), a repository of public domain lists of things: animals, foods, names, occupations, countries, etc.

  <h2>That's It</h2>

  <p>Have fun!
