  <p>National Movie Generation Month - based on <a href="https://nanogenmo.github.io/">an idea</a> based on <a href="https://twitter.com/tinysubversions/status/396305662000775168">an idea Darius Kazemi tweeted on a whim</a>.

  <p align="center"><a href="https://twitter.com/tinysubversions/status/396305662000775168"><img src="tweet.png" width="600" height="338" alt="Hey, who wants to join me in NaNoGenMo: spend the month writing code that generates a 50k word novel, share the novel & the code at the end"></a></p>

  <h2>Editions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/NaMoGenMo/2022">2022</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Goal</h2>

  <p>Spend the month of November writing code that generates a movie of 40+ minutes. This is in the spirit of <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a> and the Academy's interesting <a href="https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/93aa_rules.pdf">definition of a feature film</a> as 40 minutes.

  <h2>The Rules</h2>

  <p>The only rule is that you share at least one movie and also your source code at the end.

  <p>The source code does not have to be licensed in a particular way, so long as you share it. The code itself does not need to be on GitHub, either. We're just using this repo as a place to organize the community. (Convenient because many programmers have GitHub accounts and the Issues section works like a forum with excellent syntax highlighting.)

  <p>The "movie" is defined however you want. It could be 40 minutes of a static picture of the word "meow". It could literally grab a random movie from Wikimedia Commons. It doesn't matter, as long as it's 40+ minutes.

  <p><i>Please try to respect copyright.</i> We're not going to police it, as ultimately it's on your head if you want to just copy/paste a Stephen King movie or whatever, but the most useful/interesting implementations are going to be ones that don't engender lawsuits.

  <p>This activity starts at 12:01am GMT on Nov 1st and ends at 12:01am GMT Dec 1st.

  <h2>How to Participate</h2>

  <p>Open an issue on the edition's repo and declare your intent to participate. <i>If you already have some inkling of the kind of project you'll be doing, please title your issue accordingly.</i> You may continually update the issue as you work over the course of the month. Feel free to post dev diaries, sample output, etc.

  <p></p>Also feel free to comment on other participants' issues.

  <h2>Admins</h2>

  <p>The official admin for NaMoGenMo is @ryanfox. I'll be doing my best to keep the issues section well organized and tagged.

  <h2>Resources</h2>
  
  <p><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> - a multi-purpose command line video editing/mixing/creation tool</p>
  <p><a href="https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/">MoviePy</a> - a Python library for programatically creating and editing video</p>
  <p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a> - a repository of open videos, images, and sounds</p>

  <p>There's an open issue for each edition where you can add resources (libraries, corpuses, APIs, techniques, etc).

  <p>There is an open resources thread:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/NaMoGenMo/2022/issues/1">2020</a>
  </ul>

  <h2>That's It</h2>

  <p>Have fun!
